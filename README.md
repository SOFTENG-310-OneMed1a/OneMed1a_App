# OneMed1a - Unified Cross-Media Discovery App

> Your personalized hub for movies, books, TV shows, music, and podcasts—powered by recommendations and social discovery.

---

## What does this project do?

**OneMed1a** is a social media and entertainment tracking web application that brings together users’ favorite forms of media—movies, TV shows, books, music, and podcasts—into a single, personalized discovery platform. It tracks what you're watching or reading, recommends what to enjoy next, and lets you share your activity with friends in real-time.

---

## Why is this project useful?

Fragmented media platforms make it hard to keep track of everything we enjoy. OneMed1a solves this by:
- Centralizing all media tracking in one place
- Generating intelligent, mood-aware recommendations across different types of media
- Creating a social feed of your and your friends’ media activity
- Recommending content based on friends' top picks and shared interests

Whether you're a casual consumer or a media lover, OneMed1a helps you discover more of what you love—and connect with others who love it too.
