## Environment set up and running tests
   ### Backend setup
   - Install Java version 21
   - Install Maven
   - Install Docker (container for postgres)

   ### Frontend setup
   - Install Node.js version 18 +

   Once you have installed all the required software, first run the database through docker

   ```shell
      cd onemed1a-backend
      docker compose up -d
   ```

   After you have the database running on docker, run the sprintboot backend

   ```shell
      mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Once you have all the backend running switch to the frontend server and run the frontend
   
   ```shell
      cd onemed1a-frontend
      npm run dev
   ```

   To run backend tests switch to the backend folder, then run the following command

   ```shell
      cd onemed1a-backend
      mvn test
   ```

## Project vision & roadmap
`OneMed1a` aims to develop a unified web application that aggregates movies, TV shows, books,
and podcasts into a single discovery hub. By ingesting each user’s ratings, reviews and
wish-lists, alongside their friends’ activity, the system will generate context-aware, cross-media
recommendations (e.g. “you just finished that novel; here’s its film adaptation or a related
podcast”). A consolidated activity feed will let users track, share and save everything in one
place, transforming fragmented media browsing into a cohesive, socially driven experience.

### Our current roadmap includes:
1. Area to track media you have watched
   - Movies
   - TV Shows
   - Music
   - Books / Ebooks
   - Podcasts
2. Recommendation features:
   - Cross-media recommendation features using user’s taste from their data.
3. Tracking of watched/watching media
   - Completed, watching, plan to watch
4. Creating accounts
   - Allows users to save their accounts and save their data
5. Friends feature:
   - Add friends
   - View friend’s rating
   - View friend’s analytics (number of movies/media watched)
   - Recommends to you the friend’s top picks
6. Recommendation Features
   - Modify recommendation implementation to consider mood
7. Blend Mode (if time allows)
   - Choose a friend, combine and compare data and return a compatibility score
   - Scoreboard to display compatibility scores

## High-level design
### Frontend
  - Next JS
### Backend
  - Java SpringBoot
### Database
  - Postgres (containerized through Docker)
### User authentication
  - Up to whoever is implementing's choice
### APIs
  - OpenAI
  - TMDB
  - Spotify web API
  - Google Books API
